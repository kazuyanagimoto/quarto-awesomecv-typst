# Quarto-awesomecv-typst Format

A Quarto + Typst implementation of Byungjin Park’s [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).
The Typst implementation part is inspired by Paul Tsouchlos’s [modern-cv](https://typst.app/universe/package/modern-cv/)

```{r}
#| include: false
system2("pdftocairo", args = c("-png", "docs/template.pdf", "assets/img/template"))
system2("magick", args = c("assets/img/template-1.png", "-crop", "2000x600+0+0",
                           "assets/img/thumbnail.png"))
unlink("assets/img/template-1.png")
```

## Install

If you would like to add the clean theme to an existing directory:

```{.bash}
quarto install extension kazuyanagimoto/quarto-awesomecv-typst
```

or you can use a Quarto template that bundles a .qmd starter file:

```{.bash}
quarto use template kazuyanagimoto/quarto-awesomecv-typst
```

## Customization

### YAML

Set author information in YAML.

```yaml
author:
  firstname: Albert
  lastname: Einstein
  address: "Rämistrasse 101, CH-8092 Zürich, Switzerland, Zürich"
  position: "Research Physicist ・ Professor"
  contacts:
    - icon: fa envelope
      text: ae@example.com
      url: "mailto:ae@example.com"
    - icon: PATH_TO_ICON/icon.svg
      text: example.com
      url: https://example.com
```

- [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&o=r) icons are supported
via [duskmoon314/typst-fontawesome](https://github.com/duskmoon314/typst-fontawesome) with `fa` prefix.
- SVG icons can be used by specifying the path to the icon file (e.g., Google Scholar icon from [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/))

### Fonts & Color

You can set fonts and the accent color in YAML.

```yaml
style:
   color-accent: "516db0"
   font-header: "Roboto"
   font-text: "Source Sans Pro"
format:
  awesomecv-typst:
    font-paths: ["PATH_TO_FONT"]
```

By default, it uses the system fonts, but you can specify the font paths in the `font-paths` field (e.g., GitHub Actions usage.)

### Profile Photo

You can set a profile photo in YAML.
If you set it, the header will be left-aligned.

```yaml
profile-photo: "PATH_TO_PHOTO/photo.jpg"
```

## YAML Inputs

This templates supports the following YAML inputs:

```yaml
nobel-prize:
  title: Nobel Prize in Physics
  location: Stockholm, Sweden
  date: 1921
  description: For his services to
  details:
    - Theoritical Physics
    - Discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect
```

An item has `title`, `location`, `date`, `description`, and `details` fields.
You can add a yaml file by the following shortcode:

```yaml
{{< yaml PATH/TO/YAML.yaml >}}
```

## kazuyanagimoto/typstcv

This format is designed to be used with an R package [`kazuyanagimoto/typstcv`](http://kazuyanagimoto.com/typstcv/).
It provides helper functions to create a resume entry from a data frame.
Please refer to the package [documentation](http://kazuyanagimoto.com/typstcv/) for more details.

```{r}
library(typstcv)

educ <- data.frame(
 title = c("Ph.D. in Physics", "Master of Science"),
 location = c("Zürich, Switzerland", "Zürich, Switzerland"),
 date = c("1905", "1896 - 1900"),
 description = c("University of Zürich", "ETH")
)

resume_entry(educ)
```

```{r}
award <- data.frame(
 title = c("Nobel Prize in Physics"),
 location = c("Stockholm, Sweden"),
 date = c("1921"),
 description = c("For his services to"),
 detail1 = c("Theoretical Physics"),
 detail2 = c("Discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect")
)

resume_entry(award, details = c("detail1", "detail2"))
```

```{r}
work <- data.frame(
  title = c("Technical Assistant", "Junior Professor", "Associate Professor"),
  location = c("Bern, Switzerland", "Bern, Switzerland", "Zürich, Switzerland"),
  start = as.Date(c("1902-01-01", "1908-01-01", "1909-01-01")),
  end = as.Date(c("1908-01-01", "1909-01-01", "1911-01-01")),
  description = c("Federal Patent Office", "University of Bern",
                  "University of Zürich")
)

work |>
  format_date(end = "end", date_format = "%Y", sort_by = "start") |>
  resume_entry()
```
